      <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, 
            baking powder, sugar, and salt.
        </li>
        <li>
            In another bowl, mix the milk, egg, and melted butter until smooth.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. 
            Do not overmix; a few lumps are okay.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat a griddle or non-stick pan over medium heat. Lightly grease with butter or oil.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour 1/4 cup of batter onto the griddle for each pancake.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook until bubbles form on the surface of the pancakes and the edges look set, 
            about 2-3 minutes. Flip and cook for another 1-2 minutes until golden brown.
        </li>
